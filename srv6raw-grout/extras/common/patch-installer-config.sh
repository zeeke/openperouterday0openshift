# Patch assisted-service.env with settings required by openperouter.
# Runs before assisted-service-pod.service.
#
# - ENABLE_VIRTUAL_INTERFACES=true: tells assisted-service to include virtual
#   interfaces (bridges, etc.) in its inventory, which is required for the
#   bridge IP to pass the belongs-to-machine-cidr validation.
#
# - DISABLED_HOST_VALIDATIONS=belongs-to-majority-group: the agent's
#   connectivity checker (assisted-installer-agent/src/connectivity_check/util.go)
#   only uses physical, bonding, or VLAN interfaces for outgoing L2 checks.
#   Bridge interfaces are explicitly excluded. When the machine network IP
#   lives on br0, arping is never performed on that subnet, so the
#   "belongs-to-majority-group" validation always fails.
#   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_INTERFACES only affects inventory reporting on the
#   assisted-service side — it has no effect on the agent-side connectivity
#   checker. Until the agent is patched to support bridge interfaces, we
#   must disable this validation.

# The env file is initially created by the appliance ignition, then
# overwritten by load-config-iso.sh when the config-image ISO is mounted.
